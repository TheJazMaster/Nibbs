# Nibbs, the Interdimensional Warrior 0.2.2
A work-in-progress Cobalt Core mod that adds Nibbs from the videogame **Awesomenauts** as a homage to the now-shut-down game.

Nibbs can act as the ship's **pilot** with a lot of **backtrackable instant movement**, **stunning** attacks and transient statuses, but with **time stop** to help keep them and **heat** to offset them.

**Requires [Kokoro 1.5.0](https://github.com/Shockah/Cobalt-Core-Mods/tree/master/Kokoro)**.

The mod currently includes a fully playable 21-card and 6 (7?) artifact kit, but is missing animations, card art and dialogue.
